        <p class="text-muted text-left">Bangalore is known as the "Garden City of India" because of its greenery, broad streets and the presence of many public parks, such as Lal Bagh and Cubbon Park. Bangalore is sometimes called as the "Pub Capital of India" and the "Rock/Metal Capital of India" because of its underground music scene and it is one of the premier places to hold international rock concerts. The diversity of cuisine is reflective of the social and economic diversity of Bangalore. In May 2012, Lonely Planet ranked Bangalore third among the world's top ten cities to visit.</p>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">The journey to Lucknow had a different feel about it. The tiny lights visible from the plane were as if to welcome us! We grinned. Luck - now, as it's called 'ùòïùò¢ùò∏ùò¢ùò£ùò∞ ùò¨ùò¢ ùò¥ùò©ùò¢ùò©ùò¢ùò≥' which literally means City of Nobleperson or Highstatus. It is indeed rich in culture and tradition and the street food is worth tasting. The numerous monuments including Bhool Bhoolaiya (Maze), Ghanta Ghar, Skyline are once - in - a - lifetime experiences. Lucknow is known for embroidery works including chikankari, zari, zardozi, kamdani and gota making (gold lace weaving).</p>

The best way to explore each and every one of these wonders is to hire a city guide. It was a real adventure with an unforgettable experience which apart from being intellectually rewarding gave us a glimpse of our country's proud history. </p>

        <p>Watched "Saina". Loved it!! How beautifully Amole Gupte once again has made a brilliant movie after "Stanley ka dabba" n "Hawa hawai". Whenever he directs,  he amazes us. The movie is all about our sports icon Saina Nehwal, a girl from Hyderabad. Parineeti Chopra, though am not a big fan, she manages to charm me with this titular role. She has breathed the role. Through out the movie, the cast supports Parineeti well enough. It's a biopic and I won't give any spoiler. Must go to bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

        <p>The film tells the coming-of-age story of a teenage girl who aspires to be a singer, uploading videos on YouTube while disguising her identity with a niqab, and her relationships with her mother, father and mentor.[7] The film deals with social issues including feminism, gender equality and domestic violence. Totally worth every penny to watch!</p>

        The mercury touched 47 degree Celsius at several places in the State, while Hyderabad recorded 43.6 degrees.

        The Meteorological Department has forecast severe heat wave conditions at many places over the State on Saturday and Sunday too.

        However, there could be some relief later as the weathermen predicted isolated rain or thundershowers at some places across Telangana on May 25 and 26, 2022</p>
